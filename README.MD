# SWE Analysis & Interpolation
Contains code that generate figures and results for IoT paper:

Wireless Sensor Networks for Improved Spatial Snow Water Equivalent Estimation: from 1km2 to basin-scale

### Plot Snow pillow vs WSNs SWE for each site
snow pillow not representative of 1km2
high spatial variability exhibited by snow distribution

### Compare normalized deviation from refeence for each node between water years
data show preservation of the relative spatial distribution of SWE between different sensor stations 

### Temporal MLR variance explained basin wide and local
elevation, canopy cover, aspect, slope
add conv_canopy
convexity
hillshade

### Plot local LOO RMSE WSN and RMSE snow course vs. pillow estimate, vs snowcourse + RMSE
WSN mean/interpolation give more accurate result than pillow

### PLOT RMSE of ~global snow courses with/without WSNs.
To what spatial extent and how much does WSN provide advantage over pillow?
